### Strategy

### Scope

The scope of the site was to provide a ecommerce website for a new up and coming cycle shop, and to demonstrate the skills that I learnt on the Coding Institute Full Stack Developers course, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Python, Django python,

### Structure

The Navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen so that it’s available at all times.

The shopping cart is always  visible and accessible for the user, so there is a different CSS for mobile views so that it doesn’t collapse into the mobile nav icon.

The user can select all products, or refine their query using the categories or subcategories

The search functionally allows a user to search within the name and display all products that match.

The page restricts the amount of products to 6 and there is pagination functionality to allow the user to scan through the products on other pages.

The product details page allows to user to view more information on the product

The shopping cart page allows the user to adjust / delete items and also proceed to checkout. To enhance user experience I have removed the table slider on mobile views, instead I have modified the form so that its only contains the necessary information

The checkout page allows the user to enter in their name and address for delivery, and also make a credit card payment.

The contact page allows the user to enter a message for the administrator of the website

The footer contains links to all social media
